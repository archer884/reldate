Relative datestreams in Rust.

## Abstract

When I talk about relative dates, I'm not talking about going out with your cousin, or even about the way archaeologists put a timestamp on one rock by knowing the timestamp for a lot of other rocks. I'm talking about the following situation.

> The Lions Club meets on the third Wednesday at El Camino.

...Chances are that, even though *you* know what the "third Wednesday" is, your phone doesn't--at least not if you're using the built-in calendar for iOS or Android. This project is intended to demonstrate exactly how we can go about creating that functionality.

## Episodes

[** Relative Dates, Part 1 **](https://youtu.be/sv9fTlU7SCA?list=PLTOeCUgrkpMNEHx6j0vCH0cuyAIVZadnc)  
Also known as "the one where everything takes forever." In this episode, we set up a new cargo project and then built our command line parsing on top of a library called clap.

[** Relative Dates, Intermission **](https://youtu.be/a3bep5U6GGk?list=PLTOeCUgrkpMNEHx6j0vCH0cuyAIVZadnc)  
Also known as "the one that took even longer!" In this episode, we take a break from Rust to write the entire thing from start to finish in C#. Command line parsing provided by my own library, available on nuget. Hooray for dogfooding! :P

[** Relative dates, Part 2 **](https://youtu.be/rsqohOuBKN0?list=PLTOeCUgrkpMNEHx6j0vCH0cuyAIVZadnc)  
Also known as "the one with all the testing." In this episode, we revamp our project structure and start creating the library that's going to do all the hard work. Which means, of course, we have to write some tests!
